## Using the source code

Install HTMLy using the source code:

1. Download the latest version from the [Github repo](https://github.com/danpros/htmly/releases/latest)
2. You will get a zipped file on your hard drive with the latest release. If you don't have VPS it's better to unzip the file locally and then do the upload of the folder-content via ftp to your webspace. It's good practice to make this upload twice in order to avoid corrupted files being uploaded.
3. If you want to run htmly as main application in your Webspace you can upload it in the root directory. If you want to get an additional blog to an existing page, use a subdirectory such as `htmly`.
4. Visit your domain. If you uploaded it in root directory visit `https://www.example.com/install.php` and if in subdirectory visit `https://www.example.com/htmly/install.php`.
5. Follow the installer to install HTMLy.
6. The installer will try to delete itself. Please delete the installer manually if the `install.php` still exist.

## Using online install

Install HTMLy without downloading the source code and use the online installer:

1. Download `online-installer.php` from the [latest release](https://github.com/danpros/htmly/releases/latest)
2. If you upload it in root directory visit `https://www.example.com/online-installer.php` or if in subdirectory visit `https://www.example.com/subdirectory/online-installer.php`.
3. Follow the installer to install HTMLy.
4. Please delete the installer manually if the `online-installer.php` and `install.php` still exist.
