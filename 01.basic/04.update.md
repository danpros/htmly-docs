<!--d Updating HTMLy to the latest version d-->

Due to the most important metadata such as username, category, type, tags, publication date, and slug are in the folder name and filename which is in the 'content' folder where this folder is not touched at all, the HTMLy update process is very safe.

But just in case, you can back up the `content` folder using `Backup` page and download it. And keep in mind that if you change specific theme included in the package without changing the folder theme name, your changes will be lost, so download the theme and re-upload the theme.
