The process of HTMLy migration whether from localhost to production server, or from server to server is very easy. Here are the steps:

## From Local Development to Server

1. Transfer all files to the server
2. Go to config folder and edit the `config.ini` file
3. In `site.url` change the old address eg. `http://localhost/htmly` to new web address `https://example.com` if HTMLy installed in root directory or `https://example.com/blog` if in subdirectory
4. Go to the cache folder and delete the `index`, `page`, and `widget` folder.
5. Done
