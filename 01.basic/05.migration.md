Whether you're moving from a local development setup to a live production server or shifting from one server to another, this process can be conducted smoothly with the right steps. This guide will walk you through the essential steps needed for both scenarios, ensuring that your HTMLy website runs without a hitch in its new location.

## Migrating from Local Development to a Server

When you're ready to take your HTMLy installation from your local machine to a production server, follow these steps to ensure a seamless transition.

### 1. Transfer All Files to the Server

The first step in the migration process is to transfer all your HTMLy files from your local environment to your chosen server. You can do this using an FTP client, SSH, or any file transfer method you prefer. Ensure that all necessary files, including the core HTMLy files, themes, and any media uploads, are copied over to the server.

### 2. Edit the Configuration File

Once the files have been successfully transferred, navigate to the `config` folder of your HTMLy installation on the server. Inside this folder, you’ll find a file named `config.ini`. Open it in a text editor and locate the line that specifies `site.url`. 

### 3. Update the `site.url`

Here you need to update the URL to reflect the new address of your website. If your local address was something like:

```
http://localhost/htmly
```

You should change it to your new production URL, for example:

- If installed in the root directory: `https://example.com`
- If installed in a subdirectory: `https://example.com/blog`

This step is crucial as it informs HTMLy about its new home on the web.

### 4. Clear the Cache

Next, you need to clear out old cache files that could cause issues with your site's performance or behavior. Head to the `cache` folder within your HTMLy directory and delete the following folders:

- `index`
- `page`
- `widget`

By removing these caches, you ensure that outdated data and references are discarded, allowing your website to function smoothly.

### 5. Done!

Congratulations! You have successfully migrated your HTMLy installation from your local environment to the server. You can visit your new web address to see your website live.

## Migrating from Server to Server

If you're looking to transfer your HTMLy site from one server to another, the process is relatively straightforward. Here’s what you need to do:

### 1. Transfer All Files to the New Server

As with the local-to-server migration, you’ll need to move all files from the original server to the new one. Use your preferred file transfer method to copy every HTMLy file, theme, and any additional uploads to the new server. Ensure that all necessary files are intact.

### 2. Clear the Cache

After the transfer is complete, make sure to clear the cache following the same method as described earlier. Browse to the `cache` folder on the new server and delete the `index`, `page`, and `widget` folders. This will prevent any old data from affecting the functionality of your site on the new server.

### 3. Done!

With the files transferred and cache cleared, your HTMLy installation should be up and running on the new server. You can now check your website to ensure that everything is functioning as it should.

**Important:** Please make sure the webserver has write permission in the `cache` and `content` folders.
