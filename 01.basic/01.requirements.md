## Important

Since version 2.7.7, a few themes need at least PHP 5.5 to work properly ([info](https://github.com/danpros/htmly/issues/437)).

If you need to run it on PHP 5.3 or PHP 5.4, please download the old themes from previous version (2.7.6): [https://github.com/danpros/htmly/releases/tag/v2.7.6](https://github.com/danpros/htmly/releases/tag/v2.7.6)
